# Usage:


## CD into the bin folder and then run:

wayback_machine_downloader https://1263cf72.content.disney.io/* -a -e


## Requirements:

You will need Ruby installed. I am recommending the installer with the DevKit packages. The Windows installer can be found here: https://rubyinstaller.org/


## Notes:

I have set the download cooldown to 10 seconds otherwise the script missed a lot of files and the Wayback Machine Internet Archive's API would rate limit your connections due to how fast the script was moving.
